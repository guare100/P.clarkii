Focussing  on the invasion history of the red swamp crayfish *Procambarus clarkii* (Girard, 1852), we assessed its geographic expansion and niche trends over time. Based on its global occurrences from 1854 to 2022, multiple sequential SDMs over around 25-year intervals, have been implemented based on a set of bioclimatic variables. The environmental suitability for each period was then projected through the next periods using an ensemble procedure of commonly used SDM algorithms. As the ‘new’ records of red swamp crayfish are known, it is possible to check whether the modelling projections are concordant with the experienced expansion of the red swamp crayfish at global scale. This also permitted to analyse the realized niche of the species in the environmental space and its dynamic through time.
